When I first started using WakaTime I had only just started to flirt with the idea of moving into tech as a full time career. Back then I didn't have enough "work" to substantiate the amount of time I wanted to devote to coding. I was talking with a college bestie and she told me about Code Katas. Initially I approached them with mistrust, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was a "right answer" that was eluding me – but I eventually found that their value is not in the solutions you create to "solve" a Kata, the value is in the ways you grow in your ability to THINK about a problem. Katas are great for encouraging short burst of focused work. If you take them really seriously and give yourself deadlines (shudder)…you begin to embrace the concept of formulating a solution and "flexibly committing" to its implementation because you need to respect the fact that you need to get something out the door. I'm a long way from where I would like my productivity to be, but I'd like to think my daily routine of devoting 90 minutes or so to attacking one of these Katas in a language you feel the most productive in has significantly improved my abilities.
