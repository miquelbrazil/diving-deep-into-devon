# Diving Deep into Devon

This project is a brain dump of my 20+ years of experience working in tech and web development.

I've had the pleasure (or misfortune, depending on your perspective) of being good enough at tech to have had more than a few people ask me for my help in improving their technical skills or adopting them for the first time. By my own admission, my part in those journeys has been a mixed bag. I learned the hard way (and multiple times) that my passion for learning and innate curiosity about the world doesn't always translate for other people – particularly if they have a more pragmatic approach or reason for even pursuing tech. Frankly, I can be annoying. I talk about tech in what sometimes looks like unrelated analogies. I rattle off trivia about tech that connects the first microprocessors to the abacus. I ask knowledge-check questions that have often left people second guessing their own understandings when all I want is for them to be confident in knowing what they think they know. In short, I think I'm the only person I'm good at teaching is myself – and even I have blind spots because, like most humans, I don't always know what I don't know.

*All that said, I do know a little bit about a lot of things.*

I've started to come to believe that a better way to tell other people what I think I know is to let them discover it and explore it when they are ready for it – rather than whenever I decided to give it to them. So this project is intended to be a personal reference book and field guide to what I do in tech and why I do it that way. I want to centralize the things that have taught me, frustrated me and inspired me as I've grown…and continue to grow as a tech evangelist and developer.

For the near future, I'm going to just create Markdown files in a few rough categories. I haven't decided on the structure of the project or what tech stack I'm going to use to deploy it or any of those details. Right now I just need to get thoughts out of my head.

My current sections include:
- Stuff to Build With
- Stuff to Connect With
- Stuff to Grow With

This is definitely a work in progress.
