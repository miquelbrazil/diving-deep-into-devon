The best parts of the web is video. While the word YouTube might become the Kleenex of web content…there's no denying that video is some of the most consumable content ever created.

And there's so much of it!

I have spent embarassingly long amounts of time curating playlists on things I've wathched, I liked watching or worse – that I want to watch and haven't gotten around to it. All that time isn't a complete waste though. Sometimes there are videos specifically about tech and the content creators behind them that should be required viewing for anybody considering a career in tech.

These are some of the highlights.
