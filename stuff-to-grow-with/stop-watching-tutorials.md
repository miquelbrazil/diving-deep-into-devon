I stan for this dudes guidance on how sitting around watching tutorials isn't always the flex you might think it is. While tutorials are invaluable for making sense of the unknown for the uninitiated, in tech, there is no greater teacher than experience. I firmly believe that relying to heavily on watching somebody else make something is a good path to never really doing it yourself. I'm glad someone else agrees.
